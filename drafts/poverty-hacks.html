<h2>Well,&nbsp;folks,</h2>
<p>I have quite a lot to write about. First, though, I need to reach out to the hacker community (if there is any such thing &#8230; I have some doubts &#8230; it seems as if hacker space is just shorthand for humanity, with its cliques and cabals, tribes and territories &#8230;) and <em>give us all a slap in the face. Or&nbsp;several.</em></p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>We need&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for somebody in this community to talk about poverty. Really
talk about&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve read a lot of posts from people who say that money is not important. What&#8217;s really important is to do what you need to do, something bigger than yourself, or something that gives you fulfillment, or something that makes you feel good about getting up in the morning. Don&#8217;t work for the money, they say, because, once you have it, things are not any better. This, my friends and neighbors, enemies and colleagues, is&nbsp;bullshit.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slap-one-1">
<h2>Slap one&nbsp;(1).</h2>
<div class="section" id="we-are-full-of-shit">
<h3>We are full of&nbsp;shit</h3>
<p>unless we recognize that, for every person in my country (the <span class="caps">USA</span>, for those who are keeping score of that kind of stuff) who makes money each day, going to work, or not (good job or bad, doesn&#8217;t matter how you call it), there is a person who loses money. Every day, every minute, man, woman, child, black, white, asian, latino, african, european. That&#8217;s how much poverty there is. And I&#8217;m not talking about the 99% and the 1%, here. There&#8217;s a line, drawn across the heart of every group of people in this country. Half of them gain, at least some, every day. The other half loses. Every&nbsp;day.</p>
<p>And the thing is, if you&#8217;re in the &quot;gain&quot; half, you don&#8217;t know how it is for the &quot;lose&quot; half. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like. You can&#8217;t. But maybe you can imagine it.&nbsp;Some.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="we-re-going-to-try">
<h3>We&#8217;re going to&nbsp;try,</h3>
<p>right here. We&#8217;ll just go a little bit over the line. &quot;Lose&quot;&nbsp;some.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="imagine">
<h3>Imagine</h3>
<p>that you are a father. Work at it. Really imagine it. Make it <em>your</em> life.  You have worked since you were in high school, did a great apprenticeship, became a professional. You married, and had two kids. Things happen. You take the advice of your friends, family, government, everyone; you go back to college, finish your degree, follow your muse, and get a fine education; better than you ever could have when you were eighteen, just out of high&nbsp;school.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-have-to-work">
<h3>You have to&nbsp;work</h3>
<p>two jobs while you do this, so it takes a decade. Because your family is not able to take much of a cut in its standard of living (at least, so you believe), you take out loans to help out. Lots of them. Every freakin&#8217; loan there&nbsp;is.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="then-you-re-out">
<h3>Then you&#8217;re&nbsp;out</h3>
<p>of school, and you start to look for work in your field. Well, that doesn&#8217;t exist. You have to get more school (at this point you have two bachelor&#8217;s degress and two Master&#8217;s &#8212; follow your bliss, right?), and more school just sounds like a very long drag on everything, plus it will take until you are fifty-five years old. You don&#8217;t really even know your wife any more, if you ever really did, so &#8230; divorce. The house is long gone in the real estate debacle; you filed for bankruptcy protection too late; you really need some time to decide what to do, so you take a job, any job, just to survive. Of course, not in your previous field, because that&#8217;s full of people who <em>want</em> to do it; you followed your bliss elsewhere, <em>and there&#8217;s no work there, either</em>.&nbsp;&#8230;</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="there-are-education-jobs">
<h3>There are education&nbsp;jobs,</h3>
<p>so you do that for a while. Ten bucks an hour (and lots of vacations, good heathcare&#8212;used to be, anyway) &#8230; and most of that is taken for child support (not complaining, but there&#8217;s not enough here to pay on the loans that already supported the wife and kids, much less the interest now, nor any for even one person to live on). Your new relationship is barely there because, let&#8217;s face it, it&#8217;s nice to be able to see a movie or something, once in a while. &#8230; Every day, you go a little further in the hole, even if you just pay rent and utilities and get your food out of dumpsters. Really. And you&#8217;re way better off than most poor&nbsp;folks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="that-s-a-little-bit">
<h3>That&#8217;s a little&nbsp;bit</h3>
<p>of the picture. I think many of you can imagine most of the things I described in that paragraph, at least one at a time. I put it to each of you that, as you read, you worked, in your mind, to see how you would solve each of those problems as I described&nbsp;them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="slap-two-2">
<h2>Slap two&nbsp;(2).</h2>
<div class="section" id="you-fucked-it-up">
<h3>You fucked it&nbsp;up.</h3>
<p>That&#8217;s not how it works. You get all those problems, all at once, all the time. Then you get all the other problems. Can&#8217;t work today because your kid is out of school for a teacher&#8217;s work day and you can&#8217;t afford a sitter (no, you can&#8217;t; nobody watches kids for free, here, and you&#8217;re across the country from the free-babysitting relatives, &#8216;cause you followed your bliss &#8230; right?), so you lose a little money and hopefully not your job, and the power will be shut off unless you give them eleven hundred bucks <em>today</em>, and you&#8217;re almost out of heating oil, and it&#8217;s getting close to christmas so you get a high-interest credit card and hail-mary the whole damn&#8217; holiday (because otherwise, there&#8217;s no Christmas at all), hoping for a big tax refund in February (you can put them off that  long); but you&#8217;re behind in your child support thanks to your low-paying job, so the court takes your refund. &#8230; Getting the picture? A&nbsp;little?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="depressed-yet">
<h3>Depressed&nbsp;yet?</h3>
</div>
<div class="section" id="this">
<h3>This</h3>
<p>is a little bit like my life. I have some things better, and some things worse. I&#8217;m well on the &quot;lose&quot; side of the line; but: I am way better off than most folks on the &quot;lose&quot; side. Ah, hell. Lets just call it like it is, right? We&#8217;re losers. The best of us are losers. Everybody on the &quot;gain&quot; side of the line? They&#8217;re winners. The worst of them is still a&nbsp;winner.</p>

<h2>Slap three&nbsp;(3).</h2>
<div class="section" id="you-fucked-it-up-again">
<h3>You fucked it up <em>again</em>.</h3>
<p><em>You still think there is a way out for us.</em> It could be education (that&#8217;s a popular one), or welfare supports, or amnesty for whatever debts we may have. But the real problem is that we are on one side of a line that is enforced by behavior that is in your best interest that we continue. In order for all the winners to stay winners, all the losers have to stay losers. At least in their heads. They have to act like losers. They have to spend more than they make, so that you can spend less than you&nbsp;make.</p>

<p>to our side, we losers, to even make a dent in the problem. I know. That&#8217;s part of why I&#8217;m still here. See, I write software for losers, on the side. I provide them with tech. I help them move up, a little. I try to do it without making them even more poor. There&#8217;s no money in&nbsp;that.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="some-of-the-biggest">
<h3>Some of the&nbsp;biggest</h3>
<p>companies in this country make their money from us losers. They point out that they have a right to make a profit, and, indeed, they do have that right. But, in order for losers to move to the good side, the &quot;gain&quot; side, someone is going to have to give them stuff (useful, durable stuff; not the ticky-tacky crap that they can afford) that is good without taking their money, and teach them how to use it without telling them how poor and useless and fucked up they are. You have to believe that they are as good as you, when you know that they&#8217;re not, because they&#8217;re losers and you&#8217;re a winner. You have to help them become as skilled as you, and I know you don&#8217;t want&nbsp;to.</p>
<p>You&nbsp;suck.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="you-have-to">
<h3>You have&nbsp;to</h3>
<p>give them that stuff freely and honestly without making any one person ever feel even a tiny bit guilty about it, and you have to give it without making money yourself from them being losers. (There goes the 401K. Where did you think those winner-institutions got their money? From other&nbsp;winners?)</p>

<div class="section" id="go-on">

<p>Go on with your life. Just go away. I&#8217;ll be here with the rest of the losers, trying to push our way up. Most of us don&#8217;t much care who we hurt as we do it. We&#8217;re all losers this side of the line, anyway. Not many followers of the &quot;Golden Rule&quot;. It&#8217;s not very rewarding to help us. Most of us will steal your shit, and we will rarely say &quot;Thank&nbsp;You&quot;.</p>

<p>I still have hope. I am, like all of us, actually human. I still believe there is good everywhere, if you look for it. And, yes, before you ask &#8230; I would take a good job doing just about anything (though I really, <em>really</em> like writing code), as long as it allowed me time for my family and my loser friends and neighbors, and I could get to it from here. We have to stick together, you&nbsp;know?</p>
