1)
==

Money as we know it is symbolic. A penny is not one one-hundredth of a cent, nor is it money. It is a symbol for the purchasing power of one one-hundredth of a cent. That concept of purchasing power is one of the things that is money.

2)
==

Money, at the level of purchases in the day-to-day lives of wage-earners who, in essence, earn enough to approximately support the cost of their lives over their lifetime, is granular. It is countable and corresponds in a one-to-one ratio to the values of goods. The values of these goods may fluctuate due to many variables, but the value correspondence, in general, holds true as long as the money has any value.

3)
==

Money, at the level of large corporations, banks, lenders, exchange and stock markets, and governments, is a flow. It has value in proportion, among other things, to its liquidity (its ability to flow). When money stops flowing, it is a sign that the system by which society as a whole has espoused for the apportionment of value is breaking down.

4)
==

Money is a way of amortizing and tracking debt.

General topic: What is money?
-----------------------------

This is separable into several sub-topics.
==========================================

First:
^^^^^^

How is money defined?  Is it defined by its purposed use or by some other parameter, possibly the form in which it is used, or its historical unit of measurement?  These are probably different for different kinds of entities, e.g. financial institutions, middle class U.S. Citizens, impoverished third world householders, etc. Next:  What is the purpose of money? This can give us some indication of what money is, by way of examining the things that it is used for (or has been used for historically) and comparing it to other things that are used in similar ways.

Also:
^^^^^

What is the moral component of money? Is it good? Bad? How do we know? Is its moral dimension intrinsic to money, or is it dependent on the moral status of the user, or of the use to which it is intended to be or has been put? Do the morals attach to the money, or the intention? What about various degrees of goodness or evil associated with the desire for money, or the pursuit of money? Again, do the moral dimensions attach to the money, or to the desires, intentions, or actions of some moral agent?


Can money, or the desire for it, have the effect of diminishing moral agency (the ability to choose between right and wrong)? How might that happen?

How to define money: Purposes.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

(For this/these definition(s), money will be defined by what it is used for).

The most common use for money is as a medium of exchange.
*********************************************************

In this use money is a medium (often a precious metal or other small durable item) that allows the users to moderate the inconveniences of a barter system, most particularly the double coincidence of wants, wherein two (or more) parties have goods or services to exchange which are not currently wanted by other parties. For example, a builder cannot get meat from a butcher under a strict barter system unless the butcher wants something built at the time the builder needs meat.  If the builder has some medium which has a value to the butcher, he can use this medium to exchange for meat from the butcher even when the butcher has no desire for construction services. The butcher can then use this same medium to exchange for services or goods that he might want from some other person. Money is the name we typically give to a medium of exchange.

Money also is used as a unit of account.
****************************************

This use is enabled by the use of money as a medium of exchange. Once a money value (the amount of a good or service which can be exchanged for a specific and consistent amount of money) has been established for certain goods, money can be used to keep track of those goods. Money is usually easier to deal with than physical goods or services, and has the advantage of being track-able without the goods or services being physically present.

Money can be used as a standard of deferred payment (debt).
***********************************************************

If one individual (such as a builder or farmer) wishes to have the goods or services of another individual but has nothing to exchange, a promise to pay in the future can be given in exchange for the goods, allowing that individual access to goods and services in the present. Despite the value or lack of value of an individual's personal goods or services at any point in time, money can be used to standardize the terms by which that individual will make payment in the future.

Money can be used as a store of value.
**************************************

(In some ways, this contravenes the use of money as a medium of exchange, as storing money prevents it being exchanged for goods or services.) By storing money, individuals can increase the value of their holdings without the need to store goods or track another's services owing.

Finally, money acts as a historical record.
*******************************************

This function subsumes the other uses for money, by expressing them in its purpose. The value of each past transaction is kept by the money. The money records value of payments. Money also records the past wants/needs individuals and provides for the wants/needs of the future. So, in terms of purpose, money is a recording device.

In terms of the form it takes, money has several guises.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In many South Pacific island societies, money is a specific type of shell,
**************************************************************************

so common that it is referred to by economists as shell money. These shells have an intrinsic value given to them by their society.

Another type of money is precious metals formed into tokens.
************************************************************

These metals also have a certain value in their society, usually in proportion to the amount of metal present. Historically, the size of these tokens has been controlled by lending institutions and money storage facilities for their own convenience, as has been the number of them released into a society. Token money and shell money share the attribute of being very durable, such that their value is preserved by the nature of their construction.

Another type of money is called commodity money.
************************************************

This is money that may be constructed of any material, whose value is tied to the value of a specific commodity. For example, for many years, the value of the American dollar was specified by an amount of the precious metal, gold. The value of gold on the international market is what controlled the value of the dollar. Interestingly, John Forbes Nash, Jr. suggested a return to commodity money as a standard for the dollar, with the suggested commodity being one of the more stable-valued grains traded on the Chicago commodity market.

The most common type of money seen today is called fiat money.
**************************************************************

This is money that has been declared to have a certain purchasing power by a government which issues it, and has no value that has been tied to a commodity or service. Most currencies and coin in the world today are fiat monies that have their value tied to the U.S. Dollar, which is also a fiat money.

Another type of money is credit money.
**************************************

This is money that is given its value by the amount of debt that it represents, and is the type of money used by banks in transactions with other banks. It is freely controvertible to fiat money when used for purchases, but may or may not have the same value as any particular fiat money, as it is used for transactions outside of the fiat money economy.

The name money takes is often the unit of measurement
*****************************************************
for the commodity the money is tied to or the material from which the money was originally made. These are the pound sterling, which is the British money, or the peso, used in Mexico, among others. This is also the source of the name for the nickel. The cent and the quarter take their names from the fraction of the dollar that they represent.

What is the moral component of money?
-------------------------------------

Is it good? Bad? How do we know? Is its moral dimension intrinsic to money, or is it dependent on the moral status of the user, or of the use to which it is intended to be or has been put? Do the morals attach to the money, or to the intentions of the money's owner? What about various degrees of goodness or evil associated with the desire for money, or the pursuit of money? Again, do the moral dimensions attach to the money, or to the desires, intentions, or actions of some moral agent?

Can money, or the desire for it, have the effect of diminishing moral agency (the ability to choose between right and wrong)? How might that happen?

In effect, money is a way of representing reality, an abstraction.
------------------------------------------------------------------

It acts as representative for a host of day to day actions and transactions, and stands in for the value of real goods and services. Because it is so much more convenient to use and track than exchanges of actual goods and services, it becomes the de facto standard for the measurement of value. When we speak of the value or worth of a person or thing, we state it in terms of money; and, in fact, mean that its value is monetary, though money is actually an abstraction for the true worth of a person or thing. While some values can be measured with money, money is not the actual value. In society, there has grown up a group of individuals who serve as handlers of money, who earn their value through their ability to provide money to others. In this case, they provide money as it is needed and charge a certain amount of money for that service, money in exchange for money, as it were. The necessity of this occupation has been understood since almost the beginning of the use of money in societies.



So, what is money, really?
--------------------------

Money is an embodiment of power.
================================

A short example, with farming (which I enjoy).
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One realizes that it is not expensive to grow a certain amount of tasty food with plants, in nearly any human-survivable climate. Supplement the diet, etc. Plant some seed, add water judiciously, plants grow. Food just shows up. But there are caveats. Some work is involved in making the soil ready so that the plants provide plenty of food, then there is the control of pests, the watering every day (the plants don't care whether you may have something else to do or are out of town. If they don't get water, they die.)

Finally, the idea occurs: it's possible to impact one's lifestyle in a truly meaningful way just by digging in dirt and letting things grow. You have to commit. You need at least a few hundred square feet of soil; a couple acres is better, 20 acres even better. It is going to require a non-negotiable chunk of your time. If you have to go do something else (visit relatives, go to school, go to work) during a critical time, much of your work will be repaid with nothing but an ugly mess of useless weeds.

Once you have confronted this mess (which happens in ways beyond imagining, in places where you thought weeds could never grow), the thought occurs, with attendant guilt and sorrow. It's cheaper, by far, to go to the market and buy the same food (even if you go to an organic market, if there is any such thing), and spend the time working for the money to make those purchases. You have more time for all the things you enjoy, including spending time with your family. And you will have entered into that bargain, taking advantage of scale, whereby we use our money to force less advantaged people elsewhere to do unsavory tasks for us that we do not have the inclination to do, for less pay that we can imagine earning. And we know that those people will continue to do that work for us as long as they live in their (self-selected?) conditions, and we pay them just enough to keep them there.

Power.

Money is power.
