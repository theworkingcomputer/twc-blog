**I am back** after a week of being down the particular rabbit hole that is Windows IT, installing a test environment and repairing/resurrecting a friend's dead laptop, still celebrating my success at deploying a working Pelican installation and new/old blog and getting ready to actually make posts and website for general public consumption. Yeah.

So, I am still working on the exact code to hack the template I am declaring, but this post is the one I will be using to finally execute the last of the "hidden" posts before finally going public.

David out.
