**In the beginning** seems too arrogant. I will have more to say about anhedonia later, but this is really the start of everything. I have been programming computers since my (then) best friend Doug Booth was given a `Minivac 6010 <http://oldcomputermuseum.com/minivac_6010.html>`_ "computer". We taught it to play tic-tac-toe (not bad for a couple of ten year old kids), and a touchstone for me in every new programming language since.

It is not too much to say that Doug's interest in computers created a similar interest in me. I have always been impressionable that way.

Anyway, No Antidote for Anhedonia aims to be: Occasional thoughts on what the world is, my place in it, programming, economics, family, insects and other inconvenient biology -- the list goes on -- mostly as it applies to my work with `the Working Computer <http://theworkingcomputer.com>`_, a small company devoted to making interesting software that works, and making computers work for people who don't know how computers work.

I try to build things for people (and businesses) who need more than just a website or an app. I make interfaces that match what people of all shapes and sizes need, so that they can use computers. Much of my work goes to assist people with developmental disabilities or traumatic brain injuries. This is truly what computers are *good* for.

My name is David Moser. I live with my fiancee (and best friend) and others of our immediate family in southern New Hampshire, a region best known as "somewhere north of Boston".
