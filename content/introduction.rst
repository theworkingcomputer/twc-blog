to the official (!) blog of the Working Computer, my small effort to bring computers to people who need a different approach than the standard operating system or website.

Computers are used for many things in our society. This is good, and appropriate. They are used as computer programmers think they should and can be. Communities that, historically, contribute few individuals to the ranks of computer scientists and programmers, are, historically, served poorly by computers.

Working by the side of individuals who have developmental disabilities and/or brain injuries has convinced me that these people are part of such an underserved community; to serve them is the goal of the working Computer.


Introduction
************

**"In the beginning"** seems too arrogant. I will have more to say about anhedonia later, but this is really the start of everything. I have been programming computers since my (then) best friend Doug Booth was given a `Minivac 6010 <http://oldcomputermuseum.com/minivac_6010.html>`_ "computer". We taught it to play tic-tac-toe (not bad for a couple of ten year old kids), and a touchstone for me in every new programming language since.

It is not too much
******************
to say that Doug's interest in computers created a similar interest in me. I have always been impressionable that way.

Anyway, No Antidote for Anhedonia aims to be: Occasional thoughts on what the world is, my place in it, programming, economics, family, insects and other inconvenient biology -- the list goes on -- mostly as it applies to my work with `the Working Computer <http://theworkingcomputer.com>`_, a small company devoted to making interesting software that works, and making computers work for people who don't know how computers work.

I try to build things
*********************
for people (and businesses) who need more than just a website or an app. I make interfaces that match what people of all shapes and sizes need, so that they can use computers. Much of my work goes to assist people with developmental disabilities or traumatic brain injuries. This is truly what computers are *good* for.



My name is David Moser. I live with my fiancee/best friend and some of our immediate family in southern New Hampshire, a region best known as "somewhere north of Boston".
