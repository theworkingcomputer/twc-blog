Seems like "Hello World" is the obligatory coders first try at a new technology. For me it doesn't always work just that way. This is really my first legitimate try.

"legitimate"

I am a perfectionist. My things have to be right. I get around this, in the real world, by recognizing that almost every thing is not mine. And who has them can run them how they wish. I will even help, at need.

I will not point out, here, how long "Hello World" has taken in the saying.

Note that I am letting `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html>`_ have its head regarding formatting, styles, and themes.


Yes, this is made with `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_, a great static page generator, made with `Python <http://python.org/>`_. I recommend them both.
