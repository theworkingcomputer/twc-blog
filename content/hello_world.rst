Seems like "Hello World" really is the obligatory coders first try at a new technology. For me it doesn't always work just that way. This is really my first legitimate try.

"legitimate"

I am a perfectionist. My things have to be right. I get around this, in the real world, by recognizing that almost every thing is not mine. And whomever has them can run them howsoever they want.

I will not, here, go into how many tries it has taken me to get this the way I want it, though I will point out that, at this early juncture, I am letting `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.3.0/getting_started.html>`_ have its head.

Yes, this is made with `Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`_.
